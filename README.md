# Going straight to the source: COVID-19 and KNN'S
This project contains the backing code and data for my project at https://www.connorlandy.com/projects/going-straight-to-the-source-covid-19-and-knns. For commentary and details on the project, please refer to the website.   

## Background
Given my experience in witnessing multiple countries go through open and closure live as a result of COVID-19, I go straight to the data to get ahead of lagging media coverage, anticipate future trajectories, and try to have the semblance of a bit more control over my destiny.
